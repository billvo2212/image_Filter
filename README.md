The project needs pyGame to run. The goal to apply python 2D array of pixels to filter the given image with the following functions:

1) swapRedGreen(img) -> this function will swap the red and green color (base on RGB) of the img
2) blackWhite(img) -> this function will replace colors on the black if the sum of red, green, blue less than half of possible value of RGB, otherwise, change the pixel to white
3) reflecting(img) -> this funtion will relect the half of the image to the bottom
